## Project Overview

This project involves building a predictive model to forecast the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on multiple environmental factors such as **PM2.5**, **PM10**, **CO**, **NO2**, **SO2**, and others. The goal is to use machine learning algorithms to predict AQI values and evaluate their performance.

The project uses the following:
- **Python** for programming
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning and model evaluation
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is an air quality dataset containing pollutant measurements from various locations. It includes columns for different pollutants like **PM2.5**, **PM10**, **NO2**, and **AQI** (Air Quality Index), among others. The dataset is used to train machine learning models and predict AQI values.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary packages using **pip**:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
